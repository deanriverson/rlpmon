This app can be used as a remote monitoring and control program for your ArachnidLabs
{rlp}.  RLPmon (shown below) allows you to control the current setting of the {rlp} and
displays approximately 3 hours of data showing the current you requested, the actual
current that the {rlp} is drawing, the voltage being supplied by your source, the power
dissipated, and the internal resistance of the {rlp}.

NOTE: This software is a personal project and has not been tested on any OS other than
Mac OS X.  I have no reason to believe it won't work on Windows and Linux, but I have not
tested it personally.

=== Usage

To use RLPmon, simply plug the {rlp} USB cable into your computer, start the application
(refer to the <<quick-start,Quick Start>> section below for instructions), and open a web browser to
`http://localhost:5000`.

You will see the interface pictured above appear in your browser window.  The _Connection_
light will be green if the application properly detects your {rlp}.  If the light stays
red, check the USB connection to your {rlp}.

Once the application starts and you have a connection, you can set the requested current
by typing a value in at the top of the window.

NOTE: The temperature gauge is not functional at this time since the {rlp} firmware does
not yet report its internal temperature. It is simply there as a placeholder pending a
firmware update.


=== [[quick-start]]Quick Start (if you have Node and npm installed)

After cloning the RLPmon repository, you will need to install the Node.js modules on which
the application depends. Change into the directory containing the RLPmon software and run
the following command.

 $> npm install

Be patient, it make take a while for the Node Package Manager to download and install the
project's dependencies.  If you have any problems installing {nsp}[node-serialport], please
see that project's {nsp}#to-install[GitHub page] for installation instructions and
troubleshooting tips. When npm has finished, plug in your {rlp} if you haven't already and
run the application by typing:

 $> node app.js

=== Not so Quick Start (if you've never heard of Node and npm)

This application runs on Node.js, which gives us a way to run javascript applications
outside of the browser.  Visit the Node.js http://nodejs.org/download/[download page] to
download the installer for your OS.  After installing Node, return to the instructions
in the <<quick-start,Quick Start>> section.

NOTE: Be sure to download the current version of Node (v0.10.32 at this time). There is
an incompatibility in the node-serialport package that prevents it from working with the
more recent development versions of Node.

=== Technology and Future Directions

RLPmon is a very simple web server that uses {nsp}[node-serialport] to communicate with
the {rlp} over its USB serial port. It uses http://socket.io/[web sockets] to relay the
data and commands back and forth between the server and any clients that are connected.
This means that any desktop computer, tablet, or phone on your network that is equipped
with a modern web browser can remotely monitor and control the {rlp}. These devices don't
need to install any additional software, just open the browser and type http://localhost:5000
in the URL bar.

The line charts are rendered with http://d3js.org/[D3], a javascript visualization library.
Due to the string processing required when rendering a real-time chart with D3 and SVG,
it would be beneficial to replace this component with a direct rendering solution based on
the HTML5 canvas in the future.

Speaking of future directions, here are a few features I would like to add at some point:

* Safety interlocks so you can define a maximum power to be dissapated and tell RLPmon
to either adjust current to stay under that level or shut down the {rlp} and raise an alarm
when the level is exceded.
+
* Define a current profile so RLPmon can follow a pre-programmed sequence of current settings.
